# Adaptive Neuromorphic Control for Rhythmic Motion in Pendulums

This repository contains the MATLAB source code and figures accompanying the paper:

## 📌 Description

This work presents the analysis and design of **adaptive neuromorphic rhythmic control** based on **coupled Half-Center Oscillator (HCO) neural networks**. The contributions include:

* A theoretical study of the impact of **intrinsic neural parameters** (time constants, coupling gains) on HCO dynamics
* A **systematic design methodology** that integrates neural parameter specification with adaptive control
* A **pendulum case study** demonstrating stable and robust rhythmic oscillations across:

  * A wide frequency range → **1 Hz to 100 Hz**
  * Diverse mechanical damping conditions

The neuromorphic controller autonomously generates and regulates oscillations without requiring an explicit motion reference.
